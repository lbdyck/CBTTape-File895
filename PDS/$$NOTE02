Hello Sam,

Today I send you a zip file for CBT Tape File 895 with all the
sources, even they haven't changed.

TALLY, STEMEMCB and STEMEMCE haven't changed.  In STEMEDIT I only
changed ISPLINKÂ§ to ISPLINKA to prevent the ASCII/EBCDIC
conversion problem. DSL has been changed to use the ISPF service
QTABOPEN for finding the open ISPF tables. TALLY can be changed
the same way, but for sentimental reasons I haven't done it.

New are IS, CICSSUBS, IMSSUBS and MQSUBS. IMSSUBS and MQSUBS
based on an article from Antonio Luis Salcedo Freidel in Xephon -
DB2 update #124 February 2003 page 22ff: ISPF dialog to obtain a
list of DB2 subsystems but here the active IMS and MQ systems on
the lpar are listed. For MQ it's similar to DB2, but for IMS it's
very different to find the information.

CICSSUBS list the CICS systems on the lpar, it is also an example
of how to find the program entry in a program object.  IS is an
old CLIST which can be used like this:

//SET1 SET ENV=TEST
//TEST1 EXEC PGM=IKJEFT1A,
// PARM='IS &ENV EQ PROD'
//SYSTSPRT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSPROC DD DISP=SHR,DSN=YOUR.CLIST.DSN
//SYSTSIN DD DUMMY
//* RC = 4
//TEST2 EXEC PGM=IKJEFT1A,
// PARM='IS &ENV EQ TEST'
//SYSTSPRT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSPROC DD DISP=SHR,DSN=YOUR.CLIST.DSN
//SYSTSIN DD DUMMY
//* RC = 0

I hope you're doing fine.

Best regards
Rainer
