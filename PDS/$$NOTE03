Hello Sam,
I hope you're well and Corona hasn't got you.

3 years ago Lionel B. Dyck sent me a TSO help file for STEMEDIT.
So here is an update of CBT File 895 including this XMIT of a PO
help file as member TSOHELP.  I've added 3 REXX, one ALOCHELP is
to allocate a help file before the SYSHELP allocation, the second
ILIBS shows the concatination of libs under the ISPF DD names (so
if you use LIBDEF for ISPPLIB, you will see this libs under
ISPPLIB),the third one OLDS is one I hope no one will ever need
it, it shows LSN (Log sequence number) errors in an IMS OLDS
(OnlineLogDataSet). IMSSUBS won't work after applying some PTfs
in V14, so I changed this.  An assembler program STEMOUT is added
(just a striped down STEMEDIT for batch).

Maybe you can help me with a problem:

I installed the HDISASM load modules from the CBT file 885.  I
call it in a REXX with CALL 'dsn(HDISASM)' and  sometimes I
get an S0C4 abend. The abend is always at this point:

The next sequential instruction to be executed in program HDISASM2 was at

 displacement 00000B98.
       00000B90  92C33453      MVI     1107(R3),195
       00000B94  A7F4FFAB      BRC     15,*-170
NSI==> 00000B98  EB016FFCFF55  CLIY    -4(R6),1
       00000B9E  A774000B      BRC     7,*+22

This is in the source code:
         JNZ   CCSHX1                  BRANCH IF HEXI STRING       ยง31C
         MVI   CONTYPE,C'C'            IT'S CHAR, SO INDICATE
         J     CCONCAT                 GO COMPLETE
CCSHX1   CLIY  -4(R6),1                LBLLEN = 1 ?                ยง31C
         JNE   CCSHX2                  BRANCH IF LBLLEN NE 1       ยง31A
         TRT   0(1,R7),MIXCTRAN        CHECK 1 BYTE IS CHAR STRING ยง31A

R6  points to the beginning of the Label table. I don't
understand -4(R6), this will point to the length of the previous
label.  I think it must be 16(R6). Or should R6 always point to
the next label.

I can't change it, because the macros in SYS1.MACLIB don't work
with the JUMP commands in this assembler program. It has to be
rewritten to relative adressing or the macros have to be changed.
In file 885 it looks like you had compiled the program, so maybe
you can publish the macros you used.


Best regards and stay healthy,
Rainer
